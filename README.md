# sanchos-fit.web.app
A NextJS and TailwindCSS website made at the behest of a fitness coach I know.

The goal with this project was to make it fast and cheap. Which is why Firebase was used as the backend thanks to their generous free plan.

## Concept
The following is a comparison of what was asked from me and how the website looks as of November 24th:

Any major visible adjustments where made at the request of the client.

The code is not one I am proud of. Had I had more time, I surely would have gone back and reformatted it to be more consistent, readable and pretty.
I was given this project on very short notice and it had to be working within a fortnight. You can cleary see the spike in September of 2023 in the activity of this project:

Overall, I've managed to deliver the website on-time, but I would love to eventually come back to it and clean it up.
